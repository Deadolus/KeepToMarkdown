# KeepToMarkdown
Simple GoogleKeep Takeout exporter to [Anno Markdown](https://github.com/gwgundersen/anno/) files

The script by default expects a "Keep" folder and creates a "anno" folder.
Moves archived files in to the _archived folder, as anno also does.

Created this simple bash script because I was not able to find another program,
which worked and did what I wanted.

Note: Moves and links attachments as images, regardless of type.

# Usage
Just run the script and hope for the best
This script will take a while, if you have lots of exported notes.
